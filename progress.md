## UI/UX Direction

The current UI/UX direction follows these principles:

1. **Professional Blue/Gray Color Scheme**
   - Primary blue colors for emphasis and actions
   - Secondary gray colors for structure and content
   - Accent colors for status indicators (green for passed, yellow for in committee, blue for introduced)
   - Support for both light and dark themes based on user preference

2. **Card-Based Layout**
   - Content organized in clean, separated card components
   - Consistent padding and spacing
   - Shadow effects for depth and hierarchy

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints
   - Collapsible sidebar for smaller screens
   - Stacked layouts on mobile, grid layouts on desktop
   - Touch-friendly interactive elements

4. **Interactive Elements**
   - Tabbed interfaces for complex content (analysis dashboard)
   - Hover effects for interactive elements
   - Clear visual feedback for user actions

5. **Data Visualization**
   - Gauge visualization for sentiment analysis
   - Bar charts for topic relevance
   - Color-coded indicators for impact analysis
   - Timeline visualization for bill progression
   - Word cloud for key terms analysis
   - Network graph for stakeholder relationships
   - Comparative charts for similar legislation

## Backend Integration Notes

To complete the integration with the backend, we need to:

1. **API Endpoints**
   - [x] Confirm the structure of `/api/bills` endpoint for listing bills
   - [x] Confirm the structure of `/api/bills/{id}` endpoint for bill details
   - [x] Confirm the structure of `/api/bills/{id}/analysis` endpoint for analysis
   - [x] Create a centralized API service for frontend-backend communication

2. **Data Structure**
   - [x] Ensure the frontend models match the backend response structure
   - [x] Pay special attention to the analysis data structure
   - [x] Handle potential missing fields gracefully

3. **Authentication**
   - [ ] Determine if authentication is required
   - [ ] Implement token-based auth if needed

4. **Error Handling**
   - [x] Implement consistent error handling across all API calls
